# Taskinator

## Description
An Interactive To Do List based on the Kanban Board approach.  User can add new tasks, choose a task type, and they will be saved to localStorage on their device.  Task will show up in To Do List and can be edited or moved, by using a dropdown selector, to In Progress or Completed.  User may also delete any task item, at any time.  Currently, task type is limited to Web, Print, or Mobile.
